                    The name, <b>SAMYAK JAIN</b> and I'm a first year student doing my UG in B.Tech-CSE (AI and DS) from DIT University.
                    Apart from these things, I think I am hard working, passionate, determined, optimistic person.
                    I may not be a perfect person but according to myself I am trying my best to be perfect.
                    My hobbies are singing, playing guitar, dancing.I love cricket too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in theory that <b> "Don't be the king of one but the jack of all"</b>         
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    We all are born with some talents which cannot be done by others in a way better than us, the only need is to realize your talents
                    and work over them to improve them.I have not studied computer science till 12th standard this is my first time I have done somehing interesting like this.
                    I have tried to do my best in this.

                    Here is a poem which is very close  to my heart and I always remember it.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    'If you always try your best then you'll never have to wonder about what you could have done if you'd summoned all your thunder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if your best was not as good as you hoped it would it would be, you still could say,'
                </p>
                <p>
                   <b> "I gave today all that I had in me." </b>

                    Thank You....
